abstract = {The use of mixed languages in daily conversations, referred to as “code-switching”, has become a common linguistic phenomenon among bilingual/multilingual communities. Code-switching involves the alternating use of distinct languages or “codes” at sentence boundaries or within the same sentence. With the rise of globalization, code-switching has become prevalent in daily conversations, especially among urban youth. This lead to an increasing demand on automatic speech recognition systems to be able to handle such mixed speech. In this paper, we present the first steps towards building a multilingual language model (LM) for code-switched Arabic-English. One of the main challenges faced when building a multilingual LM is the need of explicit mixed text corpus. Since code-switching is a behaviour used more commonly in spoken than written form, text corpora with code-switching are usually scarce. Therefore, the first aim of this paper is to introduce a code-switch Arabic-English text corpus that is collected by automatically downloading relevant documents from the web. The text is then extracted from the documents and processed to be useable by NLP tasks. For language modeling, a baseline LM was built from existing monolingual corpora. The baseline LM gave a perplexity of 11841.9 and Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) rate of 4.07%. The gathered code-switch Arabic-English corpus, along with the existing monolingual corpora were then used to construct several LMs. The best LM achieved a great improvement over the baseline LM, with a perplexity of 275.41 and an OOV rate of 0.71%.}

The Hadith{--}the second source{--}refers to any action, saying, order or silent approval of the holy prophet Muhammad that has been delivered through a chain of narrators. Each Hadith has an Isnad{--}the chain of narrators{--}and a Matan{--}the act of the Prophet Muhammad. In contrast to the Quran, some Hadiths, which have been handed down over the centuries, have been corrupted by narrators who were not competent in transferring them. These have been classified by Hadith scholars as a non-authentic Hadith (NAH). To evaluate different classifiers regarding the automatic classification of Arabic Hadith, it was necessary to build Arabic Hadith corpora that contained samples of authentic and non-authentic Hadith, which were used for training models and testing. This paper aimed to create a new NAH corpus which consists of 452,624 words from six different Hadith books. The subsequent aim is to annotate this corpus to determine some Hadith features such as the Isnad, the Matan and the Hadith authenticity and to provide a ground truth.}

The case of opinion mining is of increasing interest to researchers because of its impact on policy, marketing, etc. Through this document, we are interested in the study of sentiments more specifically in informal Arabic. We present a new approach of processing and analysis that is improved through feature selection methods. The experiments we have carried out are based on the comparison of 3 feature selection methods combined with several machine learning algorithms applied on a twitter dataset. Our paper reports the enhanced results (Accuracy of 98{\%}) and shows the importance of feature selection for Arabic Sentiment Analysis.",
